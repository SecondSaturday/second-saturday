# Task: Home Dashboard UI

## Description

Build the home dashboard page that shows all user's circles with read/unread indicators, date filtering, and navigation. Includes both mobile (full-screen list) and desktop (sidebar + main content) layouts.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Dashboard page renders at `/` for authenticated users
- [x] CircleList displays all user's circles from Convex subscription
- [x] CircleListItem shows: icon, name (bold), member names preview, read/unread dot
- [x] Unread dot (colored) appears for circles with unread newsletters
- [x] Dot disappears after user views the newsletter
- [x] Member names truncate with ellipsis after ~5 names on mobile
- [x] DashboardHeader shows: user avatar, date picker, notification bell, menu (⋮)
- [x] DatePicker opens scrollable list of past issues (months)
- [x] Selecting a date filters the main content area
- [x] CreateCircleFAB shows next deadline date (e.g., "+ Oct 11")
- [x] Tapping FAB navigates to circle creation flow
- [x] Tapping a circle navigates to circle detail
- [x] Empty state shows when user has no circles with CTA to create/join
- [x] Mobile layout: full-width circle list
- [x] Desktop layout: fixed-width sidebar (~260px) + main content area
- [x] Dashboard loads within 2 seconds
- [x] Real-time updates when newsletter read status changes

## Technical Details

### Components to Build

```
src/components/dashboard/
├── HomeDashboard.tsx      # Main page layout
├── CircleList.tsx         # List with Convex subscription
├── CircleListItem.tsx     # Single circle row
├── DashboardHeader.tsx    # Header with avatar, date picker, etc.
├── DatePicker.tsx         # Scrollable month selector

└── EmptyState.tsx         # No circles CTA
```

### Page Route

- `src/app/(dashboard)/page.tsx` - Dashboard page (requires auth)

### Key Implementation Details

- Use `useQuery` from Convex for real-time circle list
- Use Tailwind responsive classes for mobile/desktop layouts
- Use shadcn/ui components: Avatar, Button, DropdownMenu
- FAB should be position: fixed, bottom-right on mobile
- Sidebar should be position: fixed on desktop

### Analytics Events

- `dashboard_viewed` - on page load
- `circle_selected` - when user taps a circle
- `date_filter_changed` - when user selects different month

## Dependencies

- [x] Task 001 (Convex Backend) complete
- [x] shadcn/ui components available
- [x] User authentication working

## Effort Estimate
