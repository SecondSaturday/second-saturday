# Task: Wire admin manual reminders in AdminSubmissionDashboard

## Description
Replace the "Coming soon" toast in `AdminSubmissionDashboard.tsx` with actual reminder functionality. Wire the existing "Send Reminder" button to call `sendAdminReminder` mutation for individual members. Add a "Send to all non-submitters" button. Display remaining reminder count and disable buttons when limit reached. (Carried from Epic 3: 3.5.6, 3.5.7, 3.5.8)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] "Send Reminder" button calls `sendAdminReminder` mutation for individual member (3.5.6)
- [ ] "Remind all non-submitters" button calls `sendBulkAdminReminder` mutation (3.5.7)
- [ ] Dashboard shows "X of 3 reminders remaining" with live count (3.5.8)
- [ ] Buttons disabled with tooltip when 0 reminders remaining (3.5.8)
- [ ] Success toast shown after reminder sent
- [ ] Error toast shown if reminder fails
- [ ] Loading state on buttons during send
- [ ] Bulk reminder counts as 1 reminder, not 1 per member

## Technical Details
- File: `src/components/AdminSubmissionDashboard.tsx`
- Replace `handleSendReminder` stub (currently shows "Coming soon" toast)
- Use `useMutation` for `sendAdminReminder` and `sendBulkAdminReminder`
- Use `useQuery` for `getAdminReminderCount` to show remaining count
- Follow existing UI patterns in the component (toast from sonner, button styling)
- Add "Remind All" button near existing individual reminder buttons

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 103 (Convex notification functions must exist)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 4
- Parallel: true (can run alongside Tasks 104, 105, 107)
