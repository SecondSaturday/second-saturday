# Task: Implement deep linking from push notifications

## Description
When a user taps a push notification, the app should open and navigate to the correct screen. Submission reminders should deep link to the submission screen for that circle. Newsletter-ready notifications should deep link to the newsletter view for that circle.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Tapping submission reminder notification opens submission screen for the specific circle
- [ ] Tapping newsletter-ready notification opens newsletter view for the specific circle
- [ ] Deep linking works when app is in background (notification tap resumes app)
- [ ] Deep linking works when app is killed (notification tap cold-starts app)
- [ ] Graceful handling if target circle no longer exists or user left circle
- [ ] Notification payload includes circleId and notification type for routing

## Technical Details
- Extend OneSignal notification click handler in `src/lib/onesignal.ts` (from Task 105)
- Notification payload structure: `{ type: 'submission_reminder' | 'newsletter_ready', circleId: string }`
- Use Next.js router to navigate: `/dashboard/circles/{circleId}/submit` for reminders, `/dashboard/circles/{circleId}/newsletter` for newsletter
- Handle cold start: check for pending notification data on app init
- Handle edge cases: circle deleted, user removed from circle

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 105 (OneSignal SDK integration and click handlers)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 4
- Parallel: false
