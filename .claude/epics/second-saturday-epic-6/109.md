# Task: Add PostHog analytics events for notifications

## Description
Add PostHog analytics tracking for all notification-related events. Track when notifications are sent, clicked, and when users update their preferences.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `push_notification_sent` event tracked with type (reminder/newsletter_ready) — in Convex actions
- [ ] `push_notification_clicked` event tracked with type — in frontend click handler
- [ ] `notification_settings_updated` event tracked with new settings values — in preferences UI
- [ ] `admin_manual_reminder_sent` event tracked with target (individual/all) and reminders_remaining — in admin dashboard

## Technical Details
- Backend events (Convex): Use PostHog server-side SDK or log for later ingestion
- Frontend events: Use existing `trackEvent()` from `src/lib/analytics.ts`
- Add tracking calls in:
  - `convex/notifications.ts` — sendPushNotification action (push_notification_sent)
  - `src/lib/onesignal.ts` — notification click handler (push_notification_clicked)
  - `src/components/NotificationPreferences.tsx` — on preference update (notification_settings_updated)
  - `src/components/AdminSubmissionDashboard.tsx` — on reminder send (admin_manual_reminder_sent)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 103 (notification functions)
- [ ] Task 106 (admin dashboard wiring)
- [ ] Task 107 (preferences UI)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 2
- Parallel: true
