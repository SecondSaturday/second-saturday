# Task: Build AdminSubmissionDashboard component

## Description
Create an admin-only submission status dashboard showing each member's submission status. Uses `getSubmissionStatus` query. Shows status indicators, deadline countdown (placeholder until Epic 4), and reminder functionality (stubbed). Accessible from circle dashboard for admin users only.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Dashboard shows each active member with submission status
- [ ] Status indicators: "Submitted" (green), "In Progress" (yellow), "Not Started" (gray)
- [ ] Shows deadline countdown placeholder ("Deadline not set" until Epic 4)
- [ ] Does NOT show content preview (privacy)
- [ ] "Send reminder" button per member (stubbed, shows "Coming soon")
- [ ] Reminder count display: "X of 3 reminders remaining" (stubbed)
- [ ] Only visible to admin users
- [ ] Regular members see nothing / get redirected
- [ ] Real-time updates via Convex subscription
- [ ] Link from circle dashboard (admin only)

## Technical Details
- Files: `src/components/AdminSubmissionDashboard.tsx`, `src/app/dashboard/circles/[circleId]/submissions/page.tsx`
- Use `getSubmissionStatus` query from Task 53
- Reminder functionality will be fully implemented in Epic 6
- All statuses will show "Not Started" until Epic 4 adds submission data

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 53: `getSubmissionStatus` query
- [ ] Task 62: Member list patterns to follow

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 4
- Parallel: true (after dependencies)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Dashboard renders correctly for admin
- [ ] Non-admin access properly restricted
- [ ] Mobile-responsive
