# Task: Build member list page and component

## Description
Create a `/dashboard/circles/[circleId]/members` page showing all active circle members. Uses existing `getCircleMembers` query. Members sorted: admin first, then alphabetical. Admin badge visible. Link to this page from the circle home/settings.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `/dashboard/circles/[circleId]/members` page renders member list
- [ ] Shows member avatar, name, and admin badge
- [ ] Sorted: admin first, then alphabetical by name
- [ ] Shows member count
- [ ] Only shows active members (no left/removed)
- [ ] Link to member list from circle dashboard page
- [ ] Admin sees "Remove" option next to each member (except themselves)
- [ ] Non-admin users see no removal options
- [ ] Mobile-responsive layout

## Technical Details
- Files: `src/app/dashboard/circles/[circleId]/members/page.tsx`, `src/components/MemberList.tsx`
- Use existing `getCircleMembers` query
- Use `getCircle` to determine if current user is admin
- Follow existing dashboard page patterns

## Dependencies

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 3
- Parallel: true (independent UI)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Member list renders correctly
- [ ] Admin badge displays properly
- [ ] Mobile-responsive
