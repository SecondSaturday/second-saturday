# Task: Build LeaveCircleModal and RemoveMemberModal

## Description
Create two modal components: LeaveCircleModal for members to leave a circle, and RemoveMemberModal for admins to remove members. LeaveCircleModal explains consequences and calls `leaveCircle`. RemoveMemberModal offers "Remove" (keep contributions) and "Remove & Block" (delete contributions) options, calls `removeMember`.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] LeaveCircleModal shows confirmation with consequences explanation
- [ ] LeaveCircleModal explains: lose access, can rejoin later, past contributions remain
- [ ] LeaveCircleModal calls `leaveCircle` mutation on confirm
- [ ] LeaveCircleModal redirects to dashboard after leaving
- [ ] LeaveCircleModal accessible from circle settings page
- [ ] RemoveMemberModal shows two options: "Remove" and "Remove & Block"
- [ ] "Remove" option explains: keeps contributions, member can rejoin
- [ ] "Remove & Block" option explains: deletes contributions, cannot rejoin
- [ ] RemoveMemberModal calls `removeMember` with appropriate `keepContributions` flag
- [ ] Both modals have cancel option
- [ ] Admin cannot see "Leave" option (must transfer first)

## Technical Details
- Files: `src/components/LeaveCircleModal.tsx`, `src/components/RemoveMemberModal.tsx`
- Integrate LeaveCircleModal into circle settings page
- Integrate RemoveMemberModal into member list (Task 62)
- Use existing UI modal/dialog patterns from the codebase

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 52: `leaveCircle` and `removeMember` mutations
- [ ] Task 62: Member list page (for RemoveMemberModal integration)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 3
- Parallel: true (after dependencies met)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Both modals functional with correct mutation calls
- [ ] Proper error handling and loading states
