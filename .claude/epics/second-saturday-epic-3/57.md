# Task: Build invite preview page

## Description
Create a public `/invite/[inviteCode]` page that shows circle details and allows users to join. For logged-in users: show "Join Circle" button. For logged-out users: show "Sign up to Join" and "Log in to Join" options. Uses existing `getCircleByInviteCode` query and `joinCircle` mutation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `/invite/[inviteCode]` page renders without authentication
- [ ] Shows circle name, description, icon, and member count
- [ ] Shows admin name
- [ ] Logged-in users see "Join Circle" button that calls `joinCircle`
- [ ] After joining, redirects to `/dashboard/circles/[circleId]`
- [ ] Logged-out users see "Sign up to Join" (links to `/sign-up?redirect=/invite/[code]`)
- [ ] Logged-out users see "Log in to Join" (links to `/sign-in?redirect=/invite/[code]`)
- [ ] Shows "Already a member" state if user is already in the circle
- [ ] Invalid invite code shows error state
- [ ] Mobile-responsive layout

## Technical Details
- Files: `src/app/invite/[inviteCode]/page.tsx`
- Extend `getCircleByInviteCode` to include admin user name (query admin via `circle.adminId`)
- Use Clerk's `useAuth` to detect login state
- Use `useMutation` for `joinCircle`
- Follow existing page patterns in `src/app/dashboard/`

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 51: `joinCircle` rejoin/block logic must be updated

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 4
- Parallel: true (independent UI work)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Page renders correctly for all states (logged in, logged out, already member, invalid code)
- [ ] Join flow works end-to-end
- [ ] Mobile-responsive
