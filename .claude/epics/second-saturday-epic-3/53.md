# Task: Add getSubmissionStatus admin query

## Description
Add `getSubmissionStatus` query to `convex/memberships.ts` that returns submission status for all active members in a circle. Admin-only access. Since content/submission tables don't exist yet (Epic 4), this will return a placeholder status structure that the admin dashboard can consume.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `getSubmissionStatus` query is admin-only (uses `requireAdmin`)
- [ ] Returns list of active members with status fields: `userId`, `name`, `imageUrl`, `status` ("Not Started"), `submittedAt` (null)
- [ ] Filters out members who have left
- [ ] Structure is ready to integrate with Epic 4 submission data
- [ ] Regular members get an authorization error

## Technical Details
- Files: `convex/memberships.ts`
- Status enum: "Submitted" | "In Progress" | "Not Started" — all default to "Not Started" until Epic 4
- Returns: `{ members: [{ userId, name, imageUrl, status, submittedAt }], deadline: null }`
- Deadline info will come from Epic 4 cycle management

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 51: Schema must be updated

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XS
- Hours: 1
- Parallel: true (can run alongside 52)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Query returns correct structure
