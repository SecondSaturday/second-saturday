# Task: Build multi-circle submission UI with auto-save and tabs

## Description
Implement the main submission screen with Instagram Stories-style horizontal tabs for multi-circle navigation, prompt response cards with text input, media preview grid, and auto-save functionality with 2-second debounce.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] MultiCircleSubmissionScreen component created
- [ ] Horizontal tabs for circle navigation (Instagram Stories-style)
- [ ] Tab status indicators (draft, submitted, locked)
- [ ] PromptResponseCard component for each prompt
- [ ] Text input with 500 character limit and counter
- [ ] MediaPreviewGrid shows up to 3 media items
- [ ] Remove media functionality working
- [ ] Auto-save with 2-second debounce (useDebounce hook)
- [ ] Auto-save indicator ("Saving...", "Saved")
- [ ] Independent drafts per circle maintained
- [ ] Navigating between tabs preserves state
- [ ] PostHog analytics events firing

## Technical Details
- Screen location: `src/screens/submissions/MultiCircleSubmissionScreen.tsx`

- Loading states for initial data fetch
- Error states for failed saves
