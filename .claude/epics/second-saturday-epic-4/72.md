# Task: Write comprehensive tests and perform manual QA

## Description
Create complete test coverage including unit tests, integration tests, and E2E tests for all submission functionality. Perform thorough manual QA on real iOS and Android devices to verify camera access, video uploads, and overall user experience.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unit tests written for validation logic (80%+ coverage)
- [ ] Unit tests for date/deadline calculations
- [ ] Unit tests for auto-save debounce logic
- [ ] Integration tests for Convex functions (createSubmission, updateResponse, uploadMedia)
- [ ] Integration tests for Mux webhook handler
- [ ] E2E tests for critical submission flows (text only, photo, video, multi-circle)
- [ ] E2E test for deadline locking
- [ ] Manual QA completed on real iOS device
- [ ] Manual QA completed on real Android device
- [ ] Camera/gallery access verified on both platforms
- [ ] Video upload end-to-end verified with Mux
- [ ] All discovered bugs fixed and retested

## Technical Details
- Test framework: Jest for unit/integration, Playwright/Cypress for E2E
- Mock Convex functions in unit tests
- Use real Convex dev environment for integration tests
- Use Mux test environment for integration tests
- E2E tests should cover:
  - Creating a submission
  - Adding text response
  - Adding photo (with compression)
  - Adding video (with progress)
  - Auto-save behavior
  - Multi-circle tab switching
  - Deadline locking
- Manual QA checklist for devices
- Bug tracking and resolution

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 004 (Photo upload) completed
- [ ] Task 005 (Video upload) completed
- [ ] Task 006 (Submission UI) completed
- [ ] Task 007 (Deadline) completed
- [ ] Test devices available (iOS and Android)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 17-23
- Parallel: false (must wait for implementation)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] 80%+ test coverage achieved
- [ ] All unit tests passing
- [ ] All integration tests passing
- [ ] All E2E tests passing
- [ ] Manual QA completed on both platforms
- [ ] Zero critical bugs remaining
- [ ] Bug fixes reviewed and merged
- [ ] Test documentation updated
