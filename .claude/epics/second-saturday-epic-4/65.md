# Task: Design Figma wireframes and generate component code

## Description
Create comprehensive Figma wireframes for the submission screens following mobile-first design (375px breakpoint). Design the multi-circle tabs with status indicators, media grid layouts, and all submission UI components. Use Figma MCP to generate initial React component code from the approved designs.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Figma wireframes created for all submission screens (mobile-first)
- [ ] Circle tabs with status indicators designed (Instagram Stories-style)
- [ ] Media grid layouts designed (up to 3 media items)
- [ ] Prompt response card designed (text input + media area)
- [ ] Deadline countdown component designed
- [ ] Auto-save indicator states designed ("Saving...", "Saved")
- [ ] Design uses existing tweakcn theme tokens and components
- [ ] Design review completed and approved
- [ ] React component code generated via Figma MCP
- [ ] Generated code reviewed and approved as starting point

## Technical Details
- Use existing shadcn/ui components where possible (buttons, inputs, cards)
- Design should accommodate text (500 char limit) + up to 3 media items per response
- Mobile-first breakpoint: 375px
- Follow Instagram Stories pattern for horizontal tabs
- Include states for: empty, draft, submitted, locked
- Design for both photo and video media types

## Dependencies
- [ ] Access to Figma workspace
- [ ] Figma MCP plugin configured
- [ ] Existing tweakcn theme documentation

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 18-22
- Parallel: true (can start immediately)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Designs approved by stakeholders
- [ ] Component code generated from Figma
- [ ] Code reviewed and committed to feature branch
- [ ] Design handoff documentation complete
- [ ] All design assets exported and accessible
