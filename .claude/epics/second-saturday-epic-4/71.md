# Task: Implement deadline countdown and submission locking

## Description
Build the deadline enforcement system that shows time remaining until the second Saturday at 10:59 AM UTC, automatically locks submissions at the deadline, and prevents editing after locking.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] DeadlineCountdown component shows time remaining
- [ ] Countdown displays in user's local timezone
- [ ] Countdown updates in real-time
- [ ] lockSubmission mutation triggers at 10:59 AM UTC on second Saturday
- [ ] Locked submissions cannot be edited
- [ ] UI shows "locked" state clearly
- [ ] Scheduled job or cron triggers locking
- [ ] Manual lock capability for admins (if needed)
- [ ] Grace period handling (if any)

## Technical Details
- Component location: `src/components/submissions/DeadlineCountdown.tsx`
- Calculate second Saturday of month
- Deadline time: 10:59 AM UTC
- Convert to user's local timezone for display
- Use interval for countdown updates
- Trigger lockSubmission mutation via scheduled job/cron
- Alternative: client-side check on page load
- Disable all editing UI when locked
- Show clear "submission locked" message
- Visual indicator in tab status

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 002 (Backend schema with lockedAt field) completed

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S

- [ ] Automatic locking works at deadline
- [ ] Locked submissions cannot be modified
- [ ] UI clearly indicates locked state
- [ ] Unit tests for date calculations
- [ ] Integration test for locking mechanism
