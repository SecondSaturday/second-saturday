# Task: ProfileHeaderImageLayout shared component

## Description

Create a shared `ProfileHeaderImageLayout` component that renders a cover image banner with a circle icon overlapping its bottom edge. Supports edit mode (with pencil/edit overlays) and display mode (read-only). Used across CircleSettings, CreateCircle, invite page, and newsletter headers.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `src/components/ProfileHeaderImageLayout.tsx` created
- [ ] Edit mode: cover image as full-width banner with edit overlay, circle icon overlapping bottom edge with edit overlay
- [ ] Display mode: same visual layout without edit overlays
- [ ] Props: `coverImageUrl`, `iconUrl`, `onCoverUpload?`, `onIconUpload?`, `editable: boolean`
- [ ] Responsive: works on mobile (375px) and desktop
- [ ] Handles missing images gracefully (placeholder/fallback)

## Technical Details

### Component props
```tsx
interface ProfileHeaderImageLayoutProps {
  coverImageUrl?: string | null
  iconUrl?: string | null
  onCoverUpload?: (file: File) => void
  onIconUpload?: (file: File) => void
  editable?: boolean
  className?: string
}
```

### Visual layout
- Cover image: full-width banner, ~150px height on mobile, ~200px on desktop
- Circle icon: ~80px circle, positioned overlapping the bottom edge of the cover by ~40px
- Edit overlays: small pencil icon buttons in top-right of cover and bottom-right of icon (only when `editable=true`)
- Uses existing `ImageUpload` component or file input for upload triggers

### Integration points (future tasks, not this task)
- CircleSettings Details tab will use this in edit mode
- CreateCircle flow will use this in edit mode
- Invite page will use this in display mode
- Newsletter header will use this in display mode

### Files affected
- `src/components/ProfileHeaderImageLayout.tsx` (new — ~80 lines)

## Dependencies
- [ ] None — can start immediately
- [ ] Design input recommended (Figma) for exact visual specifications

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Parallel: true
- Note: Design gate — may need Figma reference before starting

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Component renders in both edit and display modes
- [ ] Image uploads trigger callbacks
- [ ] Responsive on mobile and desktop
- [ ] Existing tests pass
