# Task: Dashboard header fixes

## Description

Remove the non-functional bell icon and implement a working three-dot dropdown menu in the dashboard header. The dropdown's first item is "Create a circle" linking to `/dashboard/create`. This gives circle creation a home before the FAB is repurposed.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Bell icon button completely removed from `DashboardHeader.tsx`
- [ ] Three-dot button opens a dropdown/popover menu
- [ ] Dropdown contains "Create a circle" item that navigates to `/dashboard/create`
- [ ] `onMenuOpen` prop wired correctly from `dashboard/page.tsx`
- [ ] Menu closes on item selection and outside click
- [ ] Keyboard accessible (Escape to close)

## Technical Details

### Remove bell icon (FR4)
- `src/components/dashboard/DashboardHeader.tsx:45-47` — delete the `<Button>` with `<Bell>` icon entirely

### Implement three-dot dropdown (FR1)
- Replace the plain `<Button>` with `<MoreVertical>` icon with a dropdown component
- Use shadcn `DropdownMenu` (`@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu`) if available, or a simple Popover
- First menu item: "Create a circle" with `PlusCircle` icon, links to `/dashboard/create`
- Wire the `onMenuOpen` prop from `dashboard/page.tsx` or handle state internally in the header

### Files affected
- `src/components/dashboard/DashboardHeader.tsx` (54 lines — modify)
- `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` (87 lines — wire prop if needed)

## Dependencies
- [ ] None — can start immediately

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Bell icon gone, dropdown works
- [ ] Existing tests pass
