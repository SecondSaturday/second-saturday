# Task: Newsletter as circle landing page

## Description

Replace CircleHome with the latest newsletter as the default view when a user selects a circle. Delete CircleHome and the "Make Submission" nav card since submissions are now accessed via the FAB.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Clicking a circle in the sidebar/dashboard shows the latest published newsletter
- [ ] If no newsletter exists, show an appropriate empty state ("No newsletters yet")
- [ ] `NewsletterView` component renders with circle name, cover image, and prompt sections
- [ ] `CircleHome.tsx` deleted
- [ ] "Make Submission" nav card no longer exists (deleted with CircleHome)
- [ ] Newsletter view shows real-time data via Convex subscriptions
- [ ] Back navigation works correctly

## Technical Details

### Modify circle landing: `src/app/dashboard/circles/[circleId]/page.tsx` (currently 33 lines)
- Query for the latest published newsletter for this circle
- Check if a query like `getLatestNewsletter` or `getNewslettersByCircle` exists
- If no query exists, create one in `convex/newsletters.ts` that returns the most recent published newsletter for a given circleId
- Render `NewsletterView` with the newsletter data
- If no newsletter found, render empty state with message like "No newsletters yet — submissions are open until [deadline]"

### Delete CircleHome: `src/components/CircleHome.tsx` (152 lines)
- Remove the file entirely
- Search for any imports of `CircleHome` and remove them
- The sidebar in `dashboard/page.tsx` likely renders CircleHome for the selected circle — update to render the circle page content instead

### Verify NewsletterView reuse
- `src/components/newsletter/NewsletterView.tsx` (88 lines) already exists
- Check its props: `circle`, `issueNumber`, `publishedAt`, `sections`
- May need to parse newsletter content (currently done in the newsletter/[newsletterId] route page)

### Files affected
- `src/app/dashboard/circles/[circleId]/page.tsx` (major refactor)
- `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` (update circle selection rendering)
- `src/components/CircleHome.tsx` (delete)
- Possibly `convex/newsletters.ts` (add `getLatestNewsletter` query)

## Dependencies
- [ ] None — can start immediately

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Parallel: true
- Note: May need a new Convex query if `getLatestNewsletter` doesn't exist

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Circle selection shows newsletter
- [ ] Empty state works when no newsletters
- [ ] CircleHome.tsx deleted
- [ ] No broken imports
- [ ] Existing tests pass
