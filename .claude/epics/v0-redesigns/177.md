# Task: Members tab UX redesign

## Description

Redesign the Members tab in CircleSettings: replace inline Remove buttons with three-dot menus, show "You" for current user, use plain text role labels, remove joined dates, and update the header format.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Three-dot menu (MoreVertical) per member row instead of always-visible Remove button
- [ ] Menu opens with "Remove" option (admin only, not for self)
- [ ] Current user's row shows "You" instead of their name
- [ ] Inline plain text role labels: "Admin" or "Member" (no Badge component, no Shield icon)
- [ ] No joined date shown
- [ ] Tab content header shows "Members (3)" with inline count in parentheses
- [ ] Keyboard accessible (Escape to close menu)

## Technical Details

### Members tab section in `src/components/CircleSettings.tsx`
The Members tab content was embedded from the deleted `/members` page in Epic 2 (#170). Changes:

1. **Three-dot menu (I1):** Replace `<Button>Remove</Button>` with `<DropdownMenu>` triggered by `<MoreVertical>` icon. Menu contains "Remove" item styled as destructive.

2. **"You" label (I2):** Check `member.userId === currentUser._id` and display "You" instead of `member.name`.

3. **Role labels (I3):** Replace `<Badge><Shield />Admin</Badge>` with plain `<span className="text-xs text-muted-foreground">Admin</span>` or `Member`.

4. **Remove joined date (I5):** Delete the "Joined [date]" line entirely.

5. **Header (I6):** Change section heading to `Members ({members.length})`.

### Files affected
- `src/components/CircleSettings.tsx` (Members tab section only)

## Dependencies
- [ ] None — no design gate

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Three-dot menus work with remove action
- [ ] "You" shown for current user
- [ ] Clean role labels
- [ ] No joined dates
- [ ] Existing tests pass
