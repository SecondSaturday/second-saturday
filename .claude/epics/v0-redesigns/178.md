# Task: Prompts tab and dedicated library page

## Description

Simplify the PromptsEditor by removing the inline prompt library and replacing it with a "Browse Prompt Library" row. Create a dedicated `/prompts/library` page with category tabs and per-prompt add buttons.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Inline prompt library removed from `PromptsEditor`
- [ ] "Browse Prompt Library >" row added at bottom of prompt list
- [ ] "Current Prompts 6/8" section heading above the sortable list
- [ ] `/dashboard/circles/[circleId]/prompts/library` page created
- [ ] Library page has back arrow header "Prompt Library"
- [ ] 4 category tabs: Fun, Gratitude, Reflection, Check-in
- [ ] Each prompt in a vertical list with "+" button to add
- [ ] Adding a prompt navigates back or updates state

## Technical Details

### PromptsEditor changes (FR10)
- `src/components/PromptsEditor.tsx` — remove the inline prompt library section (the `hasAvailableLibrary && promptLibrary` block)
- Add section heading: `Current Prompts {prompts.length}/8`
- Add navigation row at bottom: `"Browse Prompt Library ›"` linking to `/dashboard/circles/${circleId}/prompts/library`
- Need to pass `circleId` as a URL param or derive from context

### Dedicated library page (FR11)
- `src/app/dashboard/circles/[circleId]/prompts/library/page.tsx` (new)
- Back arrow + "Prompt Library" header
- Use shadcn `Tabs` with 4 category triggers
- Query `api.prompts.getPromptLibrary` for categories
- Each prompt rendered as a row with text + "+" button
- "+" adds the prompt (may need to communicate back to PromptsEditor, or add directly via mutation)

### Files affected
- `src/components/PromptsEditor.tsx` (simplify)
- `src/app/dashboard/circles/[circleId]/prompts/library/page.tsx` (new)

## Dependencies
- [ ] None — can start immediately
- [ ] Design input: reference screenshot for library page layout

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Inline library removed
- [ ] Browse row links to library page
- [ ] Library page has category tabs
- [ ] Adding prompts works
- [ ] Existing tests pass
