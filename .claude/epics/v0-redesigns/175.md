# Task: Newsletter month picker and response cards

## Description

Add a month picker and settings gear below the newsletter header, and redesign response cards with member avatars, card grouping, and dividers.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Centered row below circle name: month picker dropdown + settings gear icon
- [ ] Month picker shows current issue's month, opens selector to browse past issues
- [ ] Settings gear navigates to `/dashboard/circles/[circleId]/settings`
- [ ] Responses grouped inside rounded cards per prompt
- [ ] Each response shows circular avatar (with initials fallback) left of bold name
- [ ] Response text below name
- [ ] Thin horizontal dividers between responses within the same card
- [ ] Works on mobile and desktop

## Technical Details

### Month picker (FR2)
- Add below the circle name/slug in `NewsletterView`
- Query all newsletters for the circle to populate the dropdown: use `getNewslettersByCircle`
- Show month names (e.g., "February 2026")
- Selecting a month fetches and displays that newsletter
- May need to lift state up to the page level or use URL params

### Settings gear
- Small gear icon right of the month picker
- Links to `/dashboard/circles/[circleId]/settings`

### Response cards (FR4)
- `MemberResponse.tsx` or new component
- Each response: avatar (left) + name (bold) + text (below)
- All responses for one prompt wrapped in a `bg-card rounded-xl p-4` container
- Thin `border-b border-border` divider between responses (not after last)
- Avatar uses existing `Avatar` component with initials fallback

### Files affected
- `src/components/newsletter/NewsletterView.tsx` (month picker + settings gear)
- `src/components/newsletter/PromptSection.tsx` (card container)
- `src/components/newsletter/MemberResponse.tsx` (avatar + card layout)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 003 (newsletter header) — header redesign should be in place first

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Parallel: false (depends on 003)
- Design gate: Figma recommended

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Month picker filters newsletters
- [ ] Response cards show avatars with grouping
- [ ] Existing tests pass
