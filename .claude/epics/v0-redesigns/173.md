# Task: Full-page Clerk UserProfile with custom Notifications

## Description

Rewrite `/dashboard/settings` to render Clerk `<UserProfile />` as the full page experience. Avatar tap in DashboardHeader navigates here. Clerk handles all profile editing (avatar, name, email, password, connected accounts). Add a custom "Notifications" page inside UserProfile via `<UserProfile.Page>` slot API embedding `NotificationPreferences`. Sign Out and Delete Account rendered below the UserProfile.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `/dashboard/settings` renders `<UserProfile />` full-page (not inline in a card)
- [ ] Clerk's built-in tabs: Profile, Security
- [ ] Custom "Notifications" tab via `<UserProfile.Page>` embedding `NotificationPreferences`
- [ ] Sign Out button below UserProfile
- [ ] Delete Account card + dialog below UserProfile (unchanged behavior)
- [ ] All custom profile editing code deleted (ImageUpload, name Input, save button, timezone, avatarStorageId state, handleSave)
- [ ] Themed via existing `clerkAppearance` from providers.tsx
- [ ] Back arrow header "← Settings"
- [ ] Works on mobile (375px) and desktop

## Technical Details

### Rewrite `src/app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx`
```tsx
<UserProfile routing="hash">
  <UserProfile.Page label="Notifications" url="notifications" labelIcon={<Bell />}>
    <NotificationPreferences />
  </UserProfile.Page>
</UserProfile>
```

### Delete from settings page:
- `ImageUpload` import and usage
- `name`, `avatarStorageId`, `saving` state
- `handleSave` function
- `displayName`, `hasChanges` computations
- Profile Card with name input, avatar upload, timezone
- The broken inline `<UserProfile />` in a Card wrapper

### Keep:
- Back arrow header
- Sign Out button
- Delete Account card + dialog (handleReauthForDelete, handleDeleteAccount)
- Associated delete state (deleteConfirm, deleteOpen, deleting, reauth state)

### Files affected
- `src/app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx` (major rewrite)

## Dependencies
- [ ] None

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Full-page Clerk UserProfile renders correctly
- [ ] Custom Notifications tab works
- [ ] Sign out and delete account work
- [ ] All custom profile code deleted
- [ ] Existing tests pass
