# Task: Date picker as functional month picker

## Description

Replace the 12-date list DatePicker with a month picker grid. Wire the selected month to filter which newsletter is displayed when a circle is selected. Default to the most recent past second Saturday.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Month picker shows month names in a grid/wheel (not raw dates)
- [ ] Defaults to most recent past second Saturday (last delivered newsletter month)
- [ ] Selected month value passed to newsletter view to filter which issue is shown
- [ ] Selecting a different month loads the newsletter from that month
- [ ] If no newsletter exists for selected month, show appropriate empty state
- [ ] Works on mobile and desktop

## Technical Details

### Month picker UI (FR17)
- `src/components/dashboard/DatePicker.tsx` (78 lines) — replace the scrollable date list with a grid of month buttons
- Show 12 months centered on current month (6 past + 6 future, or last 12 months)
- Each button shows month name + year (e.g., "Feb 2026")
- Highlighted/selected state for current selection

### Default to last published
- Currently defaults to next upcoming Saturday
- Change to default to `getLastSecondSaturday()` or most recent past second Saturday
- Check if `getLastSecondSaturday` helper exists, or derive from `getNextSecondSaturday`

### Wire to newsletter filtering
- `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` — the `selectedDate` state drives which month is displayed
- Pass selected month/year to `DesktopCircleNewsletter` and the circle page
- Query for the newsletter matching `circleId + cycleId` where `cycleId` is derived from the selected month
- May need `getNewsletterByCycle` query or use `getNewslettersByCircle` and filter client-side

### Files affected
- `src/components/dashboard/DatePicker.tsx` (redesign)
- `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` (wire filtering)
- Possibly `src/app/dashboard/circles/[circleId]/page.tsx` (accept month filter)

## Dependencies
- [ ] None — can start immediately
- [ ] Design input: reference screenshot for picker style

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Month picker grid renders
- [ ] Selection filters newsletter display
- [ ] Defaults to last published month
- [ ] Existing tests pass
