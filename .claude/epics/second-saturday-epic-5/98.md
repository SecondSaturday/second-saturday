# Task: Build Newsletter Archive and Integrate into Circle Navigation

## Description
Create the newsletter archive view that lists all past issues for a circle (newest first), and integrate newsletter access into the existing `CircleHome.tsx` navigation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `NewsletterArchive` component lists all past newsletters for a circle
- [ ] Issues listed by date, newest first
- [ ] Each item shows: issue number, date (formatted in user's timezone), submission count
- [ ] Unread issues visually distinguished (leveraging existing `newsletterReads` data)
- [ ] Clicking an issue navigates to the newsletter web view (Task 97)
- [ ] Empty state when no newsletters exist yet
- [ ] Archive accessible from `CircleHome.tsx` (add navigation link/tab)
- [ ] Latest newsletter prominently featured (e.g., "Latest Issue" card)

## Technical Details
- Create `src/components/newsletter/NewsletterArchive.tsx`
- Use `getNewslettersByCircle` query from Task 93 (includes read status)
- Add "Newsletters" navigation entry in `CircleHome.tsx` alongside existing links (submit, members, submissions)
- Date formatting: use user's local timezone (existing pattern in codebase)
- Reuse existing UI components: `Card`, `Badge` for unread indicator
- For "[Deleted User]" display: check if user exists in responses, show placeholder if deleted

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 93: `getNewslettersByCircle` query
- [ ] Task 97: Newsletter web view page to link to

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 3
- Parallel: false (depends on 93, 97)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Archive lists all past issues correctly
- [ ] Unread indicators work
- [ ] Navigation integrated into CircleHome
- [ ] Empty state renders properly
- [ ] Links to newsletter web view work
