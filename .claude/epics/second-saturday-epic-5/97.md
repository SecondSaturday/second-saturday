# Task: Build Newsletter Web View Page and UI Components

## Description
Create the in-app newsletter viewing experience: a dedicated page for reading a newsletter and the UI components that render newsletter content (header, prompt sections, member responses with inline media).

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Newsletter web view page at `dashboard/circles/[circleId]/newsletter/[newsletterId]/page.tsx`
- [ ] Page requires authentication (redirect to sign-in if not logged in)
- [ ] Page requires circle membership (show error if not a member)
- [ ] `NewsletterView` component renders full newsletter content
- [ ] Newsletter header: circle icon, circle name, issue number, formatted date
- [ ] `PromptSection` component: prompt title + list of member responses
- [ ] `MemberResponse` component: member name, text response, inline media grid
- [ ] Photos tappable to view full-size (use existing image viewing pattern or lightbox)
- [ ] Videos play inline with Mux player controls
- [ ] Mobile-responsive layout (readable without zooming, 16px min font)
- [ ] Lazy loading for media (photos/videos)
- [ ] Marks newsletter as read via `markNewsletterRead` mutation (already exists in `convex/newsletterReads.ts`)
- [ ] Loading and error states

## Technical Details
- Create page at `src/app/dashboard/circles/[circleId]/newsletter/[newsletterId]/page.tsx`
- Use existing `useQuery` pattern for fetching newsletter data via `getNewsletterById`
- Components in `src/components/newsletter/` directory
- Reuse existing `MediaGrid` and `VideoThumbnail` components from `src/components/submissions/`
- For Mux video playback: use `@mux/mux-player-react` (check if installed) or existing video player pattern
- Use existing Tailwind theme tokens for styling
- Call `markNewsletterRead` on mount (from `convex/newsletterReads.ts`)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 93: Newsletter queries must exist

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 5
- Parallel: true (only needs Task 93)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Newsletter renders correctly on mobile and desktop
- [ ] Auth and membership checks work
- [ ] Media displays inline with responses
- [ ] Videos play with Mux controls
- [ ] Newsletter marked as read on view
- [ ] Loading/error states handled
