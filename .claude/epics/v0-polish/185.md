# Task: Onboarding — SSO pre-population, first/last name fields, floating labels, mobile-only logo

## Description

Polish the complete-profile onboarding page so SSO users (Google/Apple) get their name and avatar pre-filled, the form uses first/last name fields with floating label animation, and the logo only shows on mobile.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Avatar pre-populated from `user.imageUrl` on mount (Clerk SSO profile image); manual upload still available as override
- [ ] Name fields pre-populated from `user.firstName` / `user.lastName` on mount
- [ ] Two separate fields: "First Name" and "Last Name" (replaces single "Display Name")
- [ ] Floating label inputs: label sits inside input when empty/unfocused; animates up to small label on focus or when value exists
- [ ] Logo visible only on mobile (`md:hidden` or equivalent); hidden on desktop where right panel has branding
- [ ] Full name composed from first + last on save
- [ ] `convex/users.ts` updated to store `firstName` and `lastName` separately (or compose on save — evaluated during implementation)
- [ ] All tests pass

## Technical Details

- **File**: `src/app/complete-profile/page.tsx`
- **SSO pre-population**: Use `const { user } = useUser()` from `@clerk/nextjs`. On mount (or via `useEffect` with user as dep), set avatar to `user.imageUrl` and name fields to `user.firstName` / `user.lastName`.
- **FloatingLabelInput**: Create `src/components/ui/FloatingLabelInput.tsx`. Uses `relative` positioned container, `absolute` label that transitions with `transform translate-y` and `text-sm` on focus/fill. CSS transition via Tailwind `transition-all duration-200`.
- **Mobile-only logo**: Find logo element in `complete-profile/page.tsx` and add `md:hidden` className.
- **Schema**: Check `convex/users.ts` — if schema has `displayName`, evaluate adding `firstName`/`lastName` fields. Prefer composing full name at save time if schema change is risky.

## Dependencies

- [ ] Clerk `useUser()` hook already available in the page
- [ ] No design gates (floating label pattern is standard Material Design)

## Effort Estimate

- Size: M
- Hours: 3-4
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Tested with SSO user (fields pre-populate)
- [ ] Floating label animation working visually
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] Code reviewed
