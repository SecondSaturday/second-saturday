# Task: Circle Creation Flow — intro splash, step indicator, max-width containers, fixed CTAs, warmer copy

## Description

Redesign the 3-step circle creation wizard with an intro splash screen, a step progress indicator, centered max-width form layout, fixed bottom CTA bars, and warmer setup-complete copy. This is the largest design-driven task and requires Figma/screenshot references before implementation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Intro splash screen at `/dashboard/create`: large serif heading "Create Your Group", subtitle "Every second Saturday, connect meaningfully", supporting line "Set prompts, invite friends, and receive monthly newsletters", centered "Get Started" button advancing to Step 1; back arrow in top-left returns to dashboard
- [ ] Step progress indicator visible on every step: 3 numbered circles connected by line, labeled "1 Basic Info" / "2 Prompts" / "3 Members"; current step filled with primary accent; completed steps show checkmark; future steps muted gray
- [ ] Step 1 (create) form wrapped in centered `max-w-lg` container
- [ ] Step 1 CTA moved to fixed bottom bar with `border-t border-border` and `px-4 py-4` padding
- [ ] Step 2 (prompts) form wrapped in centered max-width container matching Settings width
- [ ] Step 2 CTA has adequate bottom padding / safe-area inset
- [ ] Setup-complete page has increased bottom padding (`pb-6` or `pb-8`)
- [ ] Setup-complete copy warmer and celebratory (exact wording agreed at implementation time)
- [ ] All tests pass

## Technical Details

- **Intro splash**: Implement as a state-gated view in `src/app/dashboard/create/page.tsx` (show splash first, advance to step 1 on "Get Started"). Alternatively a new sub-route `/dashboard/create/intro` — evaluate existing routing.
- **StepProgressIndicator**: Create `src/components/ui/StepProgressIndicator.tsx`. Props: `steps: string[]`, `currentStep: number`. Renders numbered circles with connecting lines. Use Tailwind for styling.
- **Max-width wrapper**: Wrap form content in `<div className="max-w-lg mx-auto w-full px-4">` in both create and prompts pages.
- **Fixed CTA bar**: `<div className="fixed bottom-0 left-0 right-0 border-t border-border px-4 py-4 bg-background">` — add `pb-safe` or `pb-6` for safe-area on iOS.
- **Files**:
  - `src/app/dashboard/create/page.tsx`
  - `src/app/dashboard/circles/[circleId]/prompts/page.tsx`
  - `src/app/dashboard/circles/[circleId]/setup-complete/page.tsx`
  - New: `src/components/ui/StepProgressIndicator.tsx`

## Dependencies

- [ ] Design gate: Figma for intro splash (FR1) and screenshot reference for step indicator (FR2) — implementation should pause for these if not available
- [ ] No task file dependencies (can start max-width and CTA changes before design gates resolved)

## Effort Estimate

- Size: L
- Hours: 5-8
- Parallel: false (sequential after design assets available)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Code implemented (all 8 acceptance criteria met)
- [ ] Visually verified on mobile and desktop
- [ ] StepProgressIndicator tested in isolation
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] Code reviewed
