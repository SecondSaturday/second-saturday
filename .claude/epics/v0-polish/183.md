# Task: Loading Skeletons — members list and newsletter view

## Description

Replace basic spinners with skeleton UI in two loading states: the Members tab in CircleSettings and the newsletter view. Skeletons must match the layout of the content they replace so the page doesn't shift on load.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Members tab loading state shows skeleton rows: avatar circle, name bar, role label bar — no spinner
- [ ] Newsletter view loading state shows skeleton: cover placeholder, heading bars, card placeholders — no spinner
- [ ] Skeletons use consistent skeleton styling (pulsing animation)
- [ ] No layout shift between skeleton and loaded state
- [ ] All tests pass

## Technical Details

- **Members skeleton** (`src/components/CircleSettings.tsx`, Members tab):
  - While members query is loading, render 3-4 skeleton rows
  - Each row: `rounded-full` circle (avatar size), two `rounded` bars (name ~120px, role ~60px)
  - Use `animate-pulse` with `bg-muted` fill
- **Newsletter skeleton** (`src/components/newsletter/NewsletterView.tsx`):
  - Cover: full-width `rounded-lg` block matching cover image height
  - Heading: one wide bar + one narrower bar
  - Cards: 2-3 card-shaped skeleton blocks
  - Use `animate-pulse` with `bg-muted` fill
- Check if a `Skeleton` primitive exists in `src/components/ui/` before creating one

## Dependencies

- [ ] No task dependencies
- [ ] No design gates

## Effort Estimate

- Size: S
- Hours: 2-3
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Visually verified skeleton matches content layout
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] Code reviewed
