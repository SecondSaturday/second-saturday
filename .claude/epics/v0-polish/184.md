# Task: Invite Page — ProfileHeaderImageLayout and warm copy

## Description

Transform the invite page from transactional to warm and personal. Apply `ProfileHeaderImageLayout` in display mode for the cover+icon banner, rewrite copy to be inviting, and fix the member count pluralization bug.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Invite page shows `ProfileHeaderImageLayout` in display mode: cover image banner across card top, circle icon overlapping bottom edge; muted placeholder banner if no cover image
- [ ] Heading reads: "You've been invited to join {circleName}"
- [ ] Member line reads: "A group of {memberCount} friends sharing monthly updates"
- [ ] Creator line reads: "{adminName} started this circle"
- [ ] "1 member" (singular) when count === 1; "{n} members" (plural) otherwise
- [ ] All tests pass

## Technical Details

- **File**: `src/app/invite/[inviteCode]/page.tsx`
- **ProfileHeaderImageLayout**: Already exists from Epic 3 (G9). Import and use in display/read-only mode — no edit controls needed.
- **Copy changes**: Replace existing heading, member count, and creator text with warmer variants per acceptance criteria.
- **Pluralization**: `memberCount === 1 ? '1 member' : \`${memberCount} members\``
- Verify `ProfileHeaderImageLayout` props for display mode (likely `editable={false}` or similar).

## Dependencies

- [ ] `ProfileHeaderImageLayout` interface resolved in Epic 3 (G9) — confirmed in PRD constraints

## Effort Estimate

- Size: S
- Hours: 1-2
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Visually verified layout and copy
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] Code reviewed
